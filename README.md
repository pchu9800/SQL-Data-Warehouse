# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project showcases a complete **data warehousing and analytics workflow**, covering everything from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights. Built as a **portfolio project**, it emphasizes industry-standard practices in **data engineering, modeling, and analytics**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three distinct layers:

- **Bronze Layer**  
  Stores raw source data without modifications. Data is ingested from **CSV files** into a **SQL Server database**.  

- **Silver Layer**  
  Performs data cleaning, transformation, and standardization to make the data reliable and consistent.  

- **Gold Layer**  
  Contains **business-ready data**, organized in a **star schema** for analytics and reporting.  

---

## 📖 Project Scope

The key components of this project include:

- **Data Architecture** → Designing a modern warehouse using Medallion principles.  
- **ETL Pipelines** → Extract, transform, and load processes to move data across layers.  
- **Data Modeling** → Creating **fact** and **dimension tables** optimized for analytical queries.  
- **Analytics & Reporting** → Writing SQL queries and building dashboards for actionable insights.
